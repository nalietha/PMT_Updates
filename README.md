# **Pixel Me This**

### **Relax. Unwind. Solve the Mystery.**

**Pixel Me This** is a narrative-driven coloring game that blends the satisfying, cozy mechanics of paint-by-numbers with the intrigue of a detective thriller.

Uncover scenes pixel by pixel. But look closely—what appears to be just a messy office might actually be a crime scene. Hidden within the grid are crucial clues waiting to be discovered.

## **The Vibe: Cozy Meets True Crime**

We wanted a game that scratches two itches: the need for relaxing, low-stress creativity, and the desire to engage with a mature, unfolding mystery.

It's "Pixel Noir." You might be coloring a pleasant little isometric room, but the context—a missing person, a betting slip, a broken trophy—adds a layer of atmospheric storytelling rarely found in the genre.


## **Game Goals: The Loop**

You aren't just filling squares; you are conducting an investigation.

### **1\. Paint to Reveal**

Use the palette to color in the scene based on numbered masks. As you paint, ambiguous shapes sharpen into recognizable objects.

### **2\. Find the Clues**

Not every object is just decoration. Some items are evidence. Once fully painted, clues will shimmer. Click them to collect them.

### **3\. Connect the Dots**

Return to your Detective's Corkboard. As you collect clues across different images, new narrative paths open up. Your findings determine how the story branches and which ending you uncover.


**Key Features**

* **Story Mode:** A branching narrative campaign where your coloring reveals the plot of a gritty mystery.  
* **Smart Tools:** Don't want to click every single pixel? Unlock and use tools like the **Roller** (paint lines quickly) and **Bucket Fill** (instant area completion) to tailor the experience to your relaxation level.  
* **Daily Challenges:** Fresh, standalone images delivered daily for a quick creative fix between story beats.  
* **Accessibility First:** Designed to be frustration-free. Features like "Click Lock" for smooth painting and high-contrast UI settings let you focus on the art, not the struggle.  
* **Expandable Gallery:** A growing library of pixel art packs across various themes.


**Controls**

The game is played primarily with the mouse, designed for one-handed relaxation.

**Installation & Setup**
I have a custom launcher to ensure you always have the latest version of the story and pixel art.

1. Download the Launcher
Download the latest PMT_Launcher.exe from our [releases page](Let's insert your link here later).

2. Run the Launcher
Double click to run Pixel Me This Launcher.exe. The launcher will automatically check for the latest game version and download it. Once complete, click Play.

⚠️ A Note on Windows Security Warnings ⚠️
Because we are an indie developer and have not purchased an expensive digital certificate to "sign" our application, Windows Microsoft Defender SmartScreen will likely flag the launcher the first time you run it.

This is normal and expected for new indie games. The file is safe.

To bypass this warning and run the game:

When the "Windows protected your PC" blue window appears, click the "More info" text link.

A new button will appear at the bottom. Click "Run anyway".

You will only need to do this once. After that, Windows will trust the application.
